## MIMO OFDM Packet Generator

This application is developed in Qt Creator 4 to generate transmission packets for [MIMO OFDM Joint Radar-Communication (JRC) Transceiver](https://github.com/ceyhunozkaptan/gr-mimo-ofdm-jrc):

+ Generates and sends Data Packet (DATA) and Null Data Packet (NDP) to GnuRadio flowgraphs over a UDP socket. 
+ Operates as an Application Layer or MAC Layer program that initiates transmission and controls tranmission freqeuncy.
